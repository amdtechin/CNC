   - **CNC machine maintenance checklists**

Maintenance checklists help technicians and operators perform their tasks safely and efficiently.

The following sections cover the maintenance tasks that should be performed at different times (daily to annually). These checklists assume that CNC machines undergo eight hours of operations every day, with sufficient breaks. 

You need to adjust the time period of your maintenance in accordance with usage hours, after consulting with machine OEM guidelines. Use the following checklists as a starting point to create a preventive maintenance plan that takes into account the needs and requirements of your manufacturing operation.

  - **Daily maintenance checklist**

    - The following tasks have to be done every day, assuming regular usage hours:
        - Inspect the pressure and level of lubricant. Top up if required.
        - Check coolant level. Use a coolant refractometer to ensure coolant and oil ratio is maintained.
        - Clean out the coolant disposal tray.
        - Check for moisture in pneumatic air. Drain moisture if it is detected.
        - Check pressure of pneumatic air with the pneumatic pressure gauge.
        - Wipe the complete machine with a clean rag.
        - Check the output of the voltage stabilizer. Ensure it adheres to the required specifications.
        - Check panel cooler temperature.
        - Observe noises, bangs, or any other anomalies in machine operation.
        - Watch out for for any overheating signs during machine operation.
          
  - **Weekly maintenance checklists**
   
    - The following maintenance tasks have to be done on a weekly basis:
        - Clean the complete machine shop, especially the area surrounding the machine.
        - Check for any evidence of lubricant, oil, or coolant leakage. 
        - Check and ensure all cooling fans are working properly. These include spindle motor fans, cooling system fans, and hydraulic motor fans.
        - Perform visual inspection of machine components. Apply grease or appropriate lubricant to parts that seem dry.
        - Check whether tool heads are held securely in the tool changer.
        - Lubricate v-groove, plungers, slider cap, extractor forks, keys, and springs of the tool changer.
        - Check if all electrical components such as switches and lights are working properly.

  - **Monthly maintenance checklists**

    - Maintenance checks that should be done every month include the following:
        - Clean out the chip collector close to the coolant tank.
        - Inspect, remove, and adjust jaws, chucks, and fixtures.
        - Clean or replace air filters as required.
        - Check the condition of tool heads and change them if necessary.
        - Inspect, lubricate, tighten, and adjust chains and conveyors in the machine.
        - Clean various fans of the machine to prevent dust accumulations.
        - Inspect the logs of oil, lubricant, and coolant. Check for any anomalous consumption.
        - Clean radiator grills of dust and debris.   

  - **Annual maintenance checklists**

    - CNC machine maintenance checks that need to be done annually:
        - Remove coolant cylinder tank for inspection.
        - Clean out the coolant cylinder for debris, inspect for bacteria or fungal growth, and clean the tank.
        - Drain used lubricant, clean lubricant housing, and refill it.
        - Inspect for presence of contaminants in pneumatic oil. Change it if required.
        - Replace all oil filters.
        - Run software simulations to check the alignment and indentation of tools.
        - Use software to quickly reverse the axis of the toolhead to check for backlash. If the toolhead experiences a backlash effect, further maintenance is required.
